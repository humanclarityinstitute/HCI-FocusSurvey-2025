## Description  
De-identified open dataset of 790 participants from six English-speaking countries exploring digital focus, attention, and distraction patterns.  
The survey examined how notifications, multitasking, and online behaviours influence perceived focus quality, task completion, and energy levels.  
Findings from this dataset support multiple HCI reports including *Why Can’t I Focus*, *Digital Fatigue & Energy*, *Values vs Noise*, and *Coping & Wellbeing*.

## Structure of the Dataset  
Each row = one participant response.  
Columns = survey questions and categorical answers.  
All personally identifying information has been removed.  
Missing or blank responses are recorded as empty cells.

## Verification Summary  
Six representative statistics from published HCI reports were checked against this dataset and matched within rounding tolerance.  
Verification was performed using the internal HCI_Data_Verification_Log.xlsx workbook.

## Data Integrity Note

This dataset has undergone a full internal audit by the Human Clarity Institute (HCI) to confirm the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of all source data and metadata.  
All validation steps were completed as part of HCI’s 2025 data audit initiative to ensure long-term integrity across the Institute’s open datasets.

No alterations were made to survey responses or core data values during the audit.  
Minor adjustments (e.g., metadata formatting, schema alignment, DOI cross-referencing) were applied only where required for cross-platform consistency between GitHub, Zenodo, and the HCI website.

This dataset is therefore considered **final and integrity-verified** as of the 2025 audit completion date.

## Data Verification Method (Legacy Audit Process)

This dataset was part of HCI’s first internal verification cycle, conducted before the rollout of the Institute’s standardised 2025 data-validation framework.  
The verification process for this dataset was therefore **manual and analytical**, focusing on internal accuracy and thematic integrity rather than automated schema testing.

### Process Summary
- All survey responses were **cross-checked against original collection files** for duplication or structural errors.  
- **Pivot-table analysis** in Excel was used to identify response clustering patterns and confirm consistency across categorical data.  
- Thematic clusters (e.g., “focus erosion”, “digital fatigue”, “trust degradation”) were **derived manually** through qualitative review and cross-tabulation rather than algorithmic grouping.  
- Final data tables were reconciled with metadata to ensure correct alignment of variable names, labels, and count totals.

This legacy verification process differs from HCI’s current workflow, which now employs:
1. Automated schema validation scripts,  
2. Version-locked dataset manifests, and  
3. A reproducible integrity-reporting pipeline used across all new datasets.

While the current dataset remains accurate and stable, it is retained here as a **reference example of HCI’s early verification methodology**.
