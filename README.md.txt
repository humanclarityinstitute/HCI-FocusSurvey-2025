## Description  
De-identified open dataset of 790 participants from six English-speaking countries exploring digital focus, attention, and distraction patterns.  
The survey examined how notifications, multitasking, and online behaviours influence perceived focus quality, task completion, and energy levels.  
Findings from this dataset support multiple HCI reports including *Why Can’t I Focus*, *Digital Fatigue & Energy*, *Values vs Noise*, and *Coping & Wellbeing*.
